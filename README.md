## Description
This application allows you to create a vehicle via terminal prompts that you can then use to perform the step-by-step actions associated with driving! Speed up, slow down, and depending on the vehicle you choose--you can even tow  another existing vehicle or do a wheelie!

## Installation Instructions
```bash
Download github repository --> https://github.com/ikebyers/Vehicle-Builder
```

## Usage
Open the parent directory within terminal, then enter "npm run build" to install dependencies. Then locate to the 'develop' directory and run "npm start" to access the Vehicle Builder application. Follow the prompts to select an existing vehicle or create a new one. Once completed, you'll be able to select from several action performance items to use your vehicle, select another vehicle, or exit application.
